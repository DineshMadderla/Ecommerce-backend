## E-Commerce Backend

This is the backend of an e-commerce platform built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **TypeScript**, and **MongoDB**. The backend handles user authentication, product management, cart functionality, payment processing, and more.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login, registration, and role-based authorization.
- **Product Management**: CRUD operations for products.
- **Order Management**: Create, view, and update orders.
- **Payment Integration**: Using Stripe API for secure payments.
- **Image Handling**: File uploads with Multer.
- **Data Validation**: Using Validator for sanitizing input data.
- **Caching**: Node-cache for temporary storage of frequently accessed data.
- **Logging**: Request logging using Morgan for monitoring API traffic.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the backend.
- **Express**: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for managing products, orders, and users.
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript for improved development experience.
- **Stripe**: For handling payments.
- **Multer**: For handling file uploads (e.g., product images).
- **UUID**: For generating unique identifiers.
- **Morgan**: For logging HTTP requests.
- **Node-Cache**: Simple in-memory caching solution.
- **Cloudinary**: This project uses Cloudinary to handle product image uploads and storage.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed.
- MongoDB installed locally or a MongoDB Atlas instance.
